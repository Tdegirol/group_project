As a traveler, I want to know to be able to research the exchange rate of the countries I'm planning on visiting. When I use the application, I want to be able to choose the country I'm exchanging the currency from and the currency I'm exchanging to. I also want to be able to compare the exchange rate of the country to what it was (insert time here). I want to be able to input any amount of currency and see the equivalent value of the foreign currency.
